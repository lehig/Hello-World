# **SendAFile**

This is a program that allows two users who are in the same LAN/WAN network send files to each other 
that can be either encrypted or not. There is also a way to decrypt files (If you have the correct keys 
of course). 

The encryption and decryption process uses RSA encryption which is the strongest encryption protocol and there
is no known way to thoroughly crack it without the private and public keys used in the first place.
